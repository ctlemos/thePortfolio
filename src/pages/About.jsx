                    I'm a designer with a focus on textiles and branding, passionate about turning ideas into strong visual identities. Throughout my journey, I've been committed to continuous growth, always seeking new creative challenges and ways to evolve. I believe in the power of design to connect, inspire, and communicate, and I'm excited to keep pushing boundaries in every project I take on.
